Info page named instructions menu because it best describes what the page 
is about.
The high score board shows the top ten scores, ordered from greatest (from the left)
to the smallest.
Implemented return buttons on the instructions and high score page to return to 
the home menu.
Removed drawContainer method in HomeMenu class because it is redundant.
Added background images for the home menu and game levels that suits the game more.
Initially, the windows are resizable, so the player is able to resize the windows,
but I made them non-resizable otherwise they will see the unnecessary white screen.
